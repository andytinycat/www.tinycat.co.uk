There used to be an awesome chunk of reverse-engineered documentation on Apple's DAAP, the proprietary music-sharing protocol they created, at http://tapjam.net/daap, but it seems to have disappeared off the web. I've captured it from the Wayback Machine and stuck it on [Github](http://github.com/andytinycat/daapdocs).
